# Augmented Piano Reality

This project is an Android mobile application that utilizes real-time image processing techniques (contour tracing, skin detection ... etc.) to provide simulated functionality to a hand drawing of piano keyboard. 
The application is developed using OpenCV library and C++/JNI code for image processing functions because OpenCV Java API doesnâ€™t perform well.
